speedrun rick roll project in biology

Feel free to use the code here!
I'm not responsible for what you do with it! (*evil wink*, take it as you will)
It was fun working out the catch and break statements since I rarely use them.
Idea was from [Da2dalus](https://github.com/Da2dalus/RickWare).

[I had to sadly use imgur (free content for the creator ig) because youtube keeps putting stupid ads on them which ruins them.](https://www.change.org/p/google-inc-remove-ads-from-the-youtube-video-rick-astley-never-gonna-give-you-up)
If you want to use this but don't know how to export or use this, I'm not gonna explain, not to be rude, but of other reasons.

<Never put a rick roll in a while true loop! Worst mistake of my life!>
